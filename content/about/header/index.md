<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a data scientist that hails from the world of bioinformatics. I have been working with data science for several years, currently working for the private sector whilst also doing consulting for academic projetcs.

My career began by doing research regarding evolutionary biology, specifically [molecular evolution and bayesian inference](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028297), subjects of my masters and bachelors, which were conducted at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). This context formed the basis of my knowledge in statistics and programming.

I also worked at the [National Centre for Flora Conservation](http://www.cncflora.jbrj.gov.br/portal), at the Rio de Janeiro botanic gardens.
Besides being a environmental analyst over there, I also worked as a data analyst, using R to automatize tasks, perform statistical analyses and solve data related problems in general. 

Since then, I have honed my skills as a data scientist and took the plunge to industry. I currently work for [Melhor Envio](https://melhorenvio.com.br/), mainly, but not only, doing client segmentation and metric enhancement, in order to help stakeholders make data driven decisions.

I believe technology is paramount in good decision making and to aid the resolution of problems in a broad spectre (local, global, small or big). I am 
also a keen advocate of good communication, of both data related and scientific information. Besides that, I also think is equally important to perform
analyses in a transparent, robust and reproductible way. Such is the way of good science.

My main lines of work revolve around:

* **R & Python for data analysis (and SQL for queries):**
  My main programming  language is R, where I feel at home by using the tools
  and sintax provided by the `tidyverse`. Even though, I also use `python`
  when needed (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn). I use these tools
  mainly to extract, wrangle, compile, analyse and visualize data from different
  sources, structured or not. I am also proficient in SQL (PostgreSQL) in order
  to query relational databses.

* **Statistics and Machine Learning:**
  I use statistical tools to answer questions, test hypothesis and check for robustness.
  I also implement machine learning models, such as logistic regressions, decision trees
  and unsupervised models in general. A large portion of this process relies in finding
  the adequate tool for the task in hand and fine tuning from that point. I believe that
  feature engineering is also equally important, in order to keep quality an relevance
  in the data used.

* **Data viz:**
  Essential to see patterns, send messages and/or generate insight, plots can make all difference
  in the understanding of the information contained in data. I create customized plots for reports,
  projects and general purposes. I also have experience developing dashboards (mainly in Looker).
  Also, although not the main objetive, I think a good design makes everything more pleasant.  

* **Communication:**
  Frequently, the main public interested in the outcome of an analysis is not made by the ones 
  who understand what goes under the hood.
  As such, these information should be translated in order to make complex topics easy to understand.
  Scheduled reports are also a frequent activity for any data analysis team. The academy prepares
  us for both of these scenarios and, as such, I aid in scientific writing, presentation development and
  in creating clear communication, ocasionally making use of tools such as [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
  for different types of publications.

  A little bit of all that can be checked in my blog!
